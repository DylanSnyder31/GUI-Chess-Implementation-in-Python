# GUI Chess Game

This is a fully functional GUI implementation of the game Chess, in Python.

## Motivation

My motivation behind this project was to create a Machine Learning Agent that plays chess at a superhuman level. I will be using this engine to make that project a reality.

## Screenshots

#### The board in a starting position:

## Prerequisites

* Kivy
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-kivy
```

## How to Run

Clone: 
```
git clone https://github.com/DylanSnyder31/Machine-Learning-Chess.git
```

Run:
```
python3 main.py
```

## How to Use

* To move the pieces just click the desired piece and release in the desired square 
* To castle move the king in the correct location and the rook will move on it's own 
* To promote a pawn, once the popup of the four pieces appear click on the desired piece and everything will change for you!
