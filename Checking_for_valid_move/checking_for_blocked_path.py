'''
This file is to make sure the path is clear for the pieces to move.
This file only includes the Rook and the Bishop
    A. The knight isn't here because it is allowed to jump over other pieces
    B. The King isn't here because it can only move on sqaure (unless castling)
    C. The pawn isn't here for the same reason as the king, it can only move one square
    D. THe Queen isn't here because it will steal the code for the Bishop and Rook
